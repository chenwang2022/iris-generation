# iris-generation
This is the implementation of "Generating Intra- and Inter-Class Iris Images by Identity Contrast" (accepted by IJCB 2022). Iris recognition is one of the most accurate and reliable biometric technologies. However, due to the high collection costs and privacy of the iris, it is difficult to build a large-scale iris image database for training iris recognition models. To augment limited iris data, this paper proposes an iris image generation algorithm which can produce numerous iris images with realistic composition and clear texture. The experimental results have verified that a large-scale synthetic dataset is beneficial to improving the performance of iris recognition.
